Robotnik
========

A robot simulator build upon the pyQt framework and inspired
by Jean-Pierre de la Croixâ€™s Matlab [+simiam](https://github.com/jdelacroix/simiam) project.
The main gui has been designed using [+QtCreator](http://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:Tools::QtCreator)
and is partly inspired by the gui of the
[+pySimiam](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pysimiam/) project, especially
some icons have been taken directly from it.

To run the simulator in gui mode, you must have installed:
* [Python2.7](http://www.python.org/getit/)
* [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro)
* [Numpy](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Python 3 is not officially supported.

Assuming you're using an Unix-like OS (`*BSD`, `GNU/Linux`, `OS X`, `Solaris`,
etc) and that **pyQt** is installed, go to the root directory **robotnik** and
just type in your favorite shell the following command:

```python
python robotnik.py
```

# Overview #

The **Robotnik** simulator is based on a **world** which is filled at start-up
by reading a xml template file located into the **template** directory.
